# Overview

# Process

- Created Invoice/Payment class that accepts
	- payment details (name, work, amount owed)
	- the class implements a formatter class `HasFormatter.ts` which is a method that makes sure that the payment /invoice classes have a method that returns a readable sentence that holds the details entered by the user
- Created a `ListTemplate.ts` class which reads in the data typed in by the user and renders to the user a list o of payments + invoices using the `document.createElement & append` methods
- Simple! Demonstrates clear understanding of 
	- modules
	- Interfaces
	- Public, Private, Readonly modifiers
	- DOM Manipulation
